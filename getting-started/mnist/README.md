Several solutions:

* Plain input (flat vector) - `MNIST_flat.ipynb` (97.2% on Kaggle)
* CNN - `MNIST_convolution.ipynb` (98.7% on Kaggle)
* Transfer learning (VGG) - `MNIST_VGG.ipynb` (96.2% on Kaggle)  

Note: VGG is probably too fancy and complex here, and was done anyway for reference purposes.
