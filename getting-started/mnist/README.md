# Digit Recognizer (MNIST)

https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer  

Several solutions:

* Plain input (flat vector) - `MNIST_flat.ipynb` (97.2% on Kaggle)
* CNN - `MNIST_convolution.ipynb` (98.7% on Kaggle)
* Transfer learning (VGG) - `MNIST_VGG.ipynb` (% on Kaggle)  

Note: VGG is probably an overkill for MNIST, but this was done for practice and future reference purposes.
