## Analysis tool

This is a work-in-progress tool that will help add features as different data types (numerical, categorical or ordinal) as well and run fitting on many estimators and finally score each feature to determine which helps predictions and which don't.  

train.csv and test.csv are taken from Kaggle's housing competition (getting started).
