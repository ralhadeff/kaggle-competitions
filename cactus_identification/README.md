# Aerial Cactus Identification

Competition:  
https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification

My submission kernel:  
https://www.kaggle.com/ralhadeff/keras-cnn-cactus-identification

In this folder there are 2 Jupyter Notebook files used in my initial testing (one directly on the input and one with some trivial permuations). In the final submission, I used the entire dataset rather that split into train and test sets.    
The scores obtained were **0.9948** and **0.9985**, respectively.    

**Note**: I did **not** use the publicly available test set - when I say I used all the data I meant all the data in the `train` folder provided by _kaggle_.
