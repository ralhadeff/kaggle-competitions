My submission kernel:

In this folder there are 2 Jupyter Notebook files used in my initial testing (one directly on the input and one with some trivial permuations). In the final submission, I used the entire dataset rather that split into train and test sets.    
The scores obtained were **0.9948** and **XXX**, respectively.
